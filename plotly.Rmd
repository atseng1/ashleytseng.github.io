## Load Dataset
```{r loaddataset}
set.seed(1)

data(nyc_airbnb)
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)  %>% 
  sample_n(5000)
```


## Plotly Scatterplot
```{r}
scatterplot = nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, '\nRating: ', rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)

scatterplot
```


## Plotly Boxplot
```{r}
common_neighborhoods =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(8) %>% 
  select(neighbourhood)

common_neighborhoods

interactive_box = inner_join(nyc_airbnb, common_neighborhoods, by = "neighbourhood") %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box",
          colors = "Set2")

interactive_box
```


## Plotly Boxplot
```{r}
boxplot =
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar")

boxplot
```


## ggplotly
```{r}
scatter_ggplot = 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_color_viridis() +
  coord_cartesian() +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(scatter_ggplot)
